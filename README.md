# Java-samples
Some easy samples written on Java in order to provide the basics of my skills and knowledge at OOP.

All the details about the code and its functions are described and explained in the code source.

Have a fun time testing and reviewing it!^^

P.S If you have troubles in compiling or executing the code here are some examples for you to write in the terminal command line:
--For compiling the games package - javac games/tictactoe/*.java
--For executing the games package - java games.tictactoe.interfaceTicTacToe
